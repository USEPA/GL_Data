For this data, a couple quirks.
Secchi--this is not entered consistently across years--some years it is listed multiple times for each site and water grab depth (for example, if water was taken at 5 and 25 m, the secchi is listed with each measure, see row 308-309), some years the Secchi is only listed along with one of the water grab depths for a given site and date (for example line 528-529), and some years it is listed separately from the other water quality measures (for example line 675).

Surface Temp is entered in the same inconsistent ways as Secchi.  This is at the very surface with a hand held thermometer.  It's pretty sensitive to air temp/solar heating, but is a back up for when the CTD does not work or is not dropped.

The CTD column is just which CTD was used.  It is not always filled in.

Note: Original file name for NOAA_WQ_2024_04_26.xlsx was 'WQ dat_Kelcey.lsx". Column headers were edited for reading into R.
